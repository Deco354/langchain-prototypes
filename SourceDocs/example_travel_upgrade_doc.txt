**Company Expense Guideline: Travel Upgrades - Extended Version**

Introduction:

This comprehensive document provides guidelines for employees traveling for business purposes. It specifically addresses the question of travel upgrades, which can make long journeys more comfortable and productive. We've also introduced a third-party upgrade program to enhance your travel experience.

Eligibility:

Our company understands the necessity of comfort during long-haul flights. Therefore, employees traveling internationally, especially for journeys of over 5 hours, are eligible for certain travel upgrades. This includes flights from the UK to the US.

Upgrades:

1. **Flight Upgrades**: Employees are allowed to upgrade their economy class tickets to premium economy or business class depending on the length of the journey and availability. This upgrade provides more legroom, superior onboard service, and a better selection of meals.

2. **Extra Baggage**: If you're carrying additional company materials for presentations, meetings, or conferences, the cost of extra baggage can be expensed.

3. **Airport Lounge Access**: For long layovers or early airport arrivals, employees are permitted to expense airport lounge access. This provides a quiet space to work and refresh, with complimentary food and drink.

4. **In-Flight Wi-Fi**: If you need to work during the flight, the cost of in-flight Wi-Fi can be expensed.

5. **Third-Party Upgrade Program**: We've partnered with a third-party upgrade program that allows employees to bid on unsold premium seats at a fraction of the usual cost. This program is available for participating airlines and routes.

Permitted Upgrades:

- Flight upgrades to premium economy or business class.
- Extra baggage for company materials.
- Airport lounge access during long layovers.
- In-flight Wi-Fi for work purposes.
- Bidding on premium seats through our third-party upgrade program.

Non-Permitted Upgrades:

- First-class tickets.
- Extra legroom seats or priority boarding.
- Travel insurance.
- Personal entertainment or comfort items (e.g., headphones, neck pillows).
- In-flight meals and drinks, unless included in the ticket upgrade.

Procedure:

To avail of these upgrades, please book them at the time of ticket purchase. Keep all receipts and add them to your expense report upon return. If upgrades are purchased after the ticket, pre-approval from your manager is required.

Conclusion:

Our goal is to ensure your travel is comfortable and productive. We trust you to make sensible decisions that balance comfort with cost-effectiveness. Safe travels!
